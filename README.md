# Data_Analyst_Task_5
# Titanic Dataset EDA

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship task â€” performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
3. Univariate analysis (Age, Fare distributions)
4. Bivariate analysis (Survival rate by Gender, Passenger Class)
5. Correlation heatmap
6. Pairplot for multivariate relationships
7. Summary of findings

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, third-class the lowest.
- Most passengers were aged 20â€“40 years.
- Fare distribution has extreme outliers.
- Passenger Class and Gender are strong survival indicators.
